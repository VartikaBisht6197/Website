Hi there! ğŸ‘‹ My name is Vartika Bisht, and I am a researcher working on human genetics. Beyond the lab, Iâ€™m an amalgamation of titlesâ€”cat mom, gamer , programmer, and more. Currently, Iâ€™m navigating through my cradle-to-grave journey, which began in the vibrant landscapes of India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ and has now brought me to the charming canals of the Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±. If youâ€™re reading this, it means you either know me or randomly landed on this page. The latter is a bit unusual ğŸ¤”, but regardless of how you got here, I hope you enjoy your time getting to know me! ğŸ˜Š
